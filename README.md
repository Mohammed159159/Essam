# Autonomous Robotic Vehicle

## Overview

This project aims to design and construct a versatile robotic vehicle capable of navigating a course, picking up objects, and delivering them to designated locations. The vehicle will operate in multiple modes:

- Line Following with Obstacle Avoidance: The robot will follow a predefined track while detecting and avoiding obstacles.
- Gesture Control: The robot will respond to hand gestures, allowing for intuitive control.
- Smartphone Control: The robot will be controlled remotely via a smartphone app connected through Bluetooth.
